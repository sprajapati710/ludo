# Ludo Game

Ludo is a board game that two, three, or four players may play. From the start, Each player will have four tokens, and each player’s tokens are staged in one of the four corner areas called starting square of the board in the different colors. Each token can come out of the starting square and start to play only when the owner of that token gets six on the die. If a player has one or more tokens out of the starting square already, he or she can choose a token and move it forward by the number of squares indicated by die. Tokens can be moved in the clockwise direction. If no move is possible, the turn immediately passes to the next player. If the die rolls to six, the player may choose to move existing token forward or get the new token out of its starting square. Player gets bonus turn after six on the die. On the second chance, if die rolls to six again, the player gets bonus turn again. But on the third turn, if die rolls to six again, the player can neither move forward nor gets another bonus turn, but the turn immediately passes to the next player. If anytime a move ends on a square occupied by the other player’s token, and the square is not a safe square, the token gets returned to its starting square, and the token can only reenter if the owner of the token rolls a six on the die. Whoever gets all four tokens to the final place first, wins the game.
